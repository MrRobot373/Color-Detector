# Real-Time Color Detection

This project demonstrates real-time colour detection using OpenCV. It captures frames from a video feed, converts each frame to the HSV colour space, and detects the dominant colour in the centre of the frame based on its hue value. The detected colour is displayed as text on the frame.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)

## Usage

1. Ensure you have a webcam or a video capture device connected to your computer.
2. Clone this repository or download the code files.
3. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip`.
4. A new window will open displaying the live video feed with the detected colour name.

Press the 'Esc' key to exit the program.

## Customization

You can customize the code to add more colours or modify the existing colour detection logic. The `color_detection.py` file contains a section where you can extend the colour detection by adding more hue value ranges and colour names.

Feel free to use, modify, and distribute the code as needed.
